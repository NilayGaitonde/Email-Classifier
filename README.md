# Email-Classifier
Email is an efficient and widely popular way of communication between many professionals. Email management is an important and growing problem for individuals and organizations. The blind posting of unsolicited email messages, known as spam, is an example of misuse. Spam is commonly defined as the sending of unsolicited bulk email - that is, email that was not asked for by multiple recipients. A further common definition of a spam restricts it to unsolicited commercial email, a definition that does not consider non-commercial solicitations such as political or religious pitches, even if unsolicited, as spam. Email was by far the most common form of spamming on the internet. 
The task of text classification, which encompasses email classification as well, poses difficulties because of the abundance of diverse variables in the dataset and the volume of documents.
Due to the huge and varied number of features in the dataset and the enormous number of documents, text classification—including email classification—presents difficulties.
Due to the vast number of attributes that make most documents identical, there was limited applicability of existing classification approaches in these datasets.

Classification algorithms like Naive Bayes, Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine are widely used for such text classification tasks because of the high accuracy they give. The problem of spam filtering is not a new one and there are already a dozen different approaches to the problem that have been implemented. The problem was more specific to areas like Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning. 

Giving our user more insight into their email information we have also used LDA or Latent Dirichlet Allocation which is a topic modelling algorithm that checks for the probability of two words coming together.

With the model we have a working accuracy of **97%**
